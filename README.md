Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: 5 Stars Not Enough!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2019
Review: This meal prep method is genius! Cassy Joy and her team at Fedandfit have come up with a way to take the chore out of food prep while considering budget and dietary concerns (dairy free, grain free, paleo options) in order to help you serve up a lot of tasty and fresh made dinners with minimal effort. Seriously, it's a lot of food in these plans so if you're single or young couple or perhaps empty nesters even, you can halve these recipes or plan on making them as is and stocking your freezer. You could also share ;) I am giving a copy of this to our kids' Home Ec teacher because I think it's a great method to teach high school students especially those going off to college who'll need to cook for themselves with limited time. It's also very adaptable for ministry meals - for new babies, anyone experiencing illness/surgery, deaths, etc. The recipes are very down to earth and provide a variety each week. For example in the week I posted prepped, the recipes included Italian, Mexican and Cajun - that's the one pictured - Cajun Chicken and Rice Skillet. I love this book so much and our family has enjoyed the fresh textures of the food in the plan. I appreciate that the prep itself doesn't require hours of time leaving me exhausted. In the past with most other methods, I typically shop one day and prep another because it's too tiring otherwise. With this method, that's not the case. There are pictures for each recipe in the weekly plans which I like. The time freed up after following this book's method is priceless!

Title: I can enjoy my weekends!!!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2019
Review: I still can‚Äôt believe I have a resource like this on my hands! It has changed EVERYTHING about how we feed ourselves in this household. We no longer eat the same damn food every single night throughout the week. Cassy and her team did such a well-thought to the most minimal meal prep detail for us!
1. I don‚Äôt have to break my head coming up with a shopping list to then but half of the stuff I wouldn‚Äôt use. Now I shop for exactly what I need and nothing else. Zero waste! And it‚Äôs all budget friendly!!! Better than that even.
2. She walks you through each step of preparation for every ingredient. It‚Äôs amazing! And it goes by so freaking fast. Less than 2 hours and you have meal prepped, my friend. Now you can go enjoy your weekend. I know!!!
3. The recipes... THE RECIPES!! Every night I come home from work and in 5-10 minutes I put the prepped stuff from my fridge together and put it in the oven or quickly ‚Äúcook‚Äù/warmup on the stove. But basically the stove will do the work for you while you take your bath or enjoy a little playtime with your toddler.
I‚Äôm literally blown away by how fast this all happened. I used to think that my weekend was just 2 days to get ready for my next 5 days of the week. No longer! No. This is going to be a pretty amazing summer! This book has given me hopes of freedom!!!
Thank you Cassy and team! <3

Title: Awesome structure but misses the mark for me
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2019
Review: I love the concept of this book and, I think it will save a lot of people time in the kitchen. I love to cook and already meal prep on the weekend so I bought this book to see how It could possibly be a resource for my nutrition clients. I think that it delivers in that respect. Especially for people that are not used to already eating healthy. If I am basing the review on usefulness for myself, I would give it three stars. A LOT of the recipes have nightshades, which I currently can‚Äôt eat. If it was just tomatoes, I would omit - but it‚Äôs spices, BBQ sauce, tomato sauces, etc. Also, some of the recipes, I would not classify as a full meal. For instance, BBQ meat over rice is not a full meal for me or stuffed avocados would not fill up myself or my husband. So for some of the recipes, I would have to look at ahead of time and plan to add more veggies to them to complete a dish. Other than that, I can applaud all of the hard work that clearly went into the book. It just wasn‚Äôt a total home run for me personally.

Title: Game-changing! I love cooking again!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2019
Review: This cookbook has been a lifesaver for this work-from-home mama of a 2-year-old toddler (read: total chaos at all times!) I was really struggling to get in grocery shopping & cooking (let alone budgeting!) with our busy schedule - I ended up with the same list and meals week after week (aka boring!). Cassy & Team Fed & Fit nailed this book with DELICIOUS meals, easy kitchen prep (both on prep day and later in the week), and affordable shopping lists. I have made at least 3 weeks from the book and never spent more than $70 on a week's ingredients (enough food for 12 servings!). I'm excited because it's taken out the guesswork and has made this area of life stress-free (add Instacart or grocery pick-up to the shopping task and it's a breeze!) My best advice is to choose a week, flip through to know the prep work and if you would made any modifications in advance (i.e. buy a Greek dressing vs making your own, etc), check your pantry and list, and go! This book is WELL worth it's value...I am super thankful to have it in our kitchen!! <3 Bravo!

Title: More than a cook book, it‚Äôs a life hack!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2019
Review: I really like this cookbook and I am no cook, but this book makes me feel like I am! Step by step instructions that don‚Äôt overwhelm. It‚Äôs so practical for me as a mom of 3 boys! My husband was able to help with the meal prep on the weekend and then during the busy week, boom, i have fresh DELICIOUS dinner cooking IN THE OVEN in about 5 mins. I‚Äôve had time to clean up kitchen, set table and enjoy my family without slaving away everyday in the kitchen for dinner! I‚Äôm going to start doubling the recipes so we can all have lunch the next day too. My boys have loved all the recipes! Fed and Fit delivers AGAIN! Life hack cook book for sure!

Title: Saves you time and money while providing healthy, unique meals!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2019
Review: I have been using this for about 4 weeks now and I originally thought it would just be a supplement to my normal cooking routine, mixing in the recipes and weeks when I wanted a change. Once I started using it, I couldn't stop. It has saved so much money and time and provides flavorful fantastic dishes that my family loves. She really knows how to craft 3 unique meals from 3 basic ingredients and it's totally changed the way I meal prep. If you are looking for a way to save money, reduce the time you spend in the kitchen, while providing healthy, tasty meals to your family you need to order this now!
